# AutoEncoders Notebook and Implementation
This repository contains a notebook and implementation of autoencoders, a type of neural network that can be used to learn efficient representations of data.

## Autoencoders
Autoencoders are a type of neural network that are trained to reconstruct their input. This forces the network to learn a compressed representation of the data, which can be useful for tasks such as dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
Autoencoders are typically composed of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input data and compresses it into a latent representation. The decoder then takes this latent representation and reconstructs the original input data.

## Notebook
The notebook in this repository provides an overview of autoencoders and how they can be implemented using TensorFlow. The notebook also includes an example of how to use autoencoders to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset of handwritten digits.

## Implementation
The implementation in this repository is a simple implementation of an autoencoder using TensorFlow. The implementation includes code for the encoder, decoder, and training loop.

## Usage
To use the autoencoder in this repository, you will need to have TensorFlow installed. You can then run the notebook to train the autoencoder on a dataset of handwritten digits.
